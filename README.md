## Introduction
For my last English class of the school year I prepared a static website with a collection of my classes' favorite games to play together in a competition against each other in groups. The game was played on a computer hooked up to a projector for all the students to see. The students sat in groups of 2 or 3 and each group had a whiteboard to write their answers on.
A student chose which game to play from the buttons on the left. Each game can be played 5 times. On the 5th time, the button would deactivate.

### Don't Match Game
On their whiteboards, students write an answer to the question on the screen but to get the full amount of points their answer must not match the answer of any other group .

On click of the Points button, a random number (from 5 to 50) appears. Groups that wrote the same answers get half of the number.

### Word + word = newWord
Taking hints from the pictures on the screen the students write the compound word that the pictures represent. There is a button that shows the answer on click and a points button.

### Karina's Top 5s
Students must write what they think are my Top 5 of the topic on the screen. I click on the box to reveal the answer and it changes from red to green. If a student wrote the same answer they get the points written on the box. If the student have the answer in a different place they get 5 points.

### Make new words
Students are shown a word or phrase and they must make and write words using the letters in that word. They get points for each correctly spelled word they wrote.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Lessons learned
I got a lot of practice manipulating the DOM in JavaScript, especially methods like .append() and .after() and their difference.
I learned how to import and export data between JS files and using that to keep my code cleaner and more organized.

## Improvements
I think some aspects of this website lend themselves well to becoming React components. I will clean up my code to make it more readable and practice React.
I also want to make an function that would congratulate the players once all of the games are finished.
